# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

When you make changes, the page will load once again.\
Any lint mistakes could also be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

The test runner is started in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build has been minified, and the hashes are present in the filenames.\
You can now launch your app!

### `npm run eject`

**This is a one-way procedure, please note. You cannot 'eject' once you have done so!**

You have the option to "eject" at any time if you're not happy with the build tool and configuration choices. With this command, you can decouple your project from the single build dependency.

Instead, all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) will be copied directly into your project, giving you complete control over them. With the exception of "eject," all of the commands will still function, but they will now point to the copied scripts so you can edit them. You're on your own at this point.

Never use the 'eject' command. You shouldn't feel pressured to adopt the curated feature set because it is appropriate for small and middle-sized deployments. However, we recognise that if you were unable to customise this tool when you were ready for it, it wouldn't be very useful.
